## What is Pokedex?
Pokedex is a modern but simple Android app that has the following features:
- Displays a list of all Pokemons
- You can click on a pokemon to see more info on that particular pokemon.
- You can search for a particular pokemon in the searchbar.

The app is built with scalability in mind, using the latest Android developmen practices. It is built using MVVM architecture, and makes use of Modularization.
